# Sustainable Business Directory: Australia & New Zealand

A free, open-source website listing sustainable businesses across Australia and New Zealand. Each listing includes a sustainability rating, business type, key practices, and indicators of greenwashing where applicable.

The platform will include a public submission feature, allowing users to suggest companies for review. All submissions will be moderated and verified before publication.

Research and business profiles will be documented using GitHub Issues and Markdown files.

All information will be peer-reviewed or supported by credible sources before inclusion.

The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; it will be hosted publicly via GitHub Pages and made open source for free public access.

### Defining Sustainability

**Social Responsibility**

-  Fair and ethical treatment of workers
-  Support for communities and charitable engagement
-  Safe products and practices that do not harm people
-  Contribution to broader societal well-being
-  Long-term vision beyond short-term profit
-  Transparent governance and value alignment


### Business Assessment Criteria
